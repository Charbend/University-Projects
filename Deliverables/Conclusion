Drew Heald EECS 325 Project 2 results
Correlation coefficient for my data was 0.68285095987773, which is a decent correlation, but I believe a few anomalous results brought the correlation down.
With more data, I'm sure it would be higher.
The high correlation would indicate that the more hops are necessary, the higher the RTT.

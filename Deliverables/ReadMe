Drew Heald EECS 325 Project 2
To run: in VM, type:
	sudo python3 distMeasurement.py
Program takes no arguments. If you want to test it with different websites, add them to the website txt file in the folder.
Program prints results to terminal, and to a "measurements" txt file. I didn't delete the one I generated for the graph, so if you just run the program, it'll append to the existing file.
